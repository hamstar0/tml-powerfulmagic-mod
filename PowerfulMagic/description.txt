Magic attacks are now 3x as powerful, but use 2.5x as much mana. Also, mana restoring items and natural regeneration only recover 1/5 as much. Mana Potions are also less available, and Mana Sickness above 3 seconds will lock down magic use. Configurable.

This mod is for anyone interested in a shakeup to mage playthroughs, or a fun twist to game modes. It gives magic a clear role for use as power attacks, which also works to compliment regular attacks. In this way, magic doesn't simply become relegated to its dedicated class to gather dust when other classes are being focused upon.
